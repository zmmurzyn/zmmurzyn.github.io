I envision myself as far more than the architect I have trained to be. Graphic designer, illustrator, collage maker, photographer, watercolour artist, weekend furniture maker, winter-only knitter, and year-round embroiderer. I have been striving to apply and expand my skill set in various opportunities surrounding the architecture and design industry. Throughout my studies, one of the most rewarding phases of a project was always the publication phase in which one has to juggle designing layouts, editing and binding booklets, producing studio-wide exhibitions, or leading the project’s presentation. Participation in
these projects taught me the importance of presentation and communication skills in the architectural industry. I went on to acquire professional experience in graphic design: producing bespoke artwork for events, designing and curating small exhibitions, as well as organising large-scale events during my position at Studium Generale. The variety of tasks I have been handling as part of that role draw beyond the archetypal role of a graphic designer, but I believe that it only reinforces my ability to go the extra mile for the projects I’m committed to.

I possess a strong foundation in communicating and writing about modern take on architectural preservation and weiterbauen. The topic of adaptive
reuse became the focus of my master thesis project (Why should we save ugly buildings?*, 2023), but it has also been a recurring theme in most of the architectural research I took part in. Embracing transformative architecture, respecting
a project’s context, and working with the existing urban fabric, those are some values I believe your office stands for and values that profoundly resonate with me. An example of this is the on-going Museum of London West Smithfield project which in a very novel and respective manner engages with existing heritage.
Van Eyck encourages us to make play an integral part in the process of making and designing. Taking up this approach, we inevitably begin discussing and questioning architecture through the lens of social and natural sciences, engineering, and history. The architectural training at TU Delft,
along with my diverse set of experiences, has equipped me with a set of skills and a spectrum of knowledge that allow me to start those conversations. I trust that through this letter, I am seen not only as a candidate for the position of a graphic designer, but also as a genuine fan of the work of Stanton Williams and the values your company promotes for our industry.
