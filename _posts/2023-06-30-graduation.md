# master graduation project | why should we save ugly buildings
<img src="/assets/ZMM_portrait_square.jpg" width="200" height="200">

My master thesis project discussed, often disliked by the general public, brutalistic giants of the 70s and the posibilities and cultur- al need for their revival. ‘Why should we save ugly buildings’ was not an ordinary project defence but a public consultation with the audience to try and represent why and how brutalism and heritage buildings could live on in the style of new preservation.
